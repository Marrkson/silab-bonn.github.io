### Topic: Development of a beam test cooling system

(_Last modified on_: {{ "2022-04-08 00:00:00 +0000" | date: '%B %d, %Y' }})

- Type: Bachelor
- Location: SiLab (on premises)
- Contact: [Christian Bespin](mailto:bespin@physik.uni-bonn.de) (de/en)
- Languages: German or English
- Description: Many (intentionally irradiated) semiconductor detectors need to be cooled to about -20 Â°C for measurements.
We developed a cooling solution based on dry ice for  experiments in beam telescopes (see introduction above) that should be automated to achieve constant temperatures at the detector.
- Task: The existing solution could be improved together with our technicians and an automatic temperature stabilisation with a feedback loop is to be implemented. The system should be tested in the lab or possibly during an actual beam test experiment.
- Tools: Raspberry Pi/Arduino, sensing electronics, lots of dry ice, Python programming language
