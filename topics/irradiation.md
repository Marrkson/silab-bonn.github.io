- Description: Radiation levels within a close vicinity of the cooling box shortly after irradiation of samples are in the low **mSv/h** region. Since this lies in the order of the average equivalent dose **per year** in Germany ([~ 2 mSv / year](https://www.bfs.de/EN/topics/ion/environment/natural-radiation-exposure/natural-radiation-exposure_node.html)) it requires thorough consideration when planning any worksteps. In order to get a quantitative measure of radiation levels at the setup, a gas discharge counter can be used. The aim of this work is to integrate such a device into hard- and software as well as performing an approximate _counts-to-dose_ calibration. Interpretation/visualization of the data have to be implemented and integrated into an already existing Python application.
