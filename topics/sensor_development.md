- Description: Guard rings, located outside of the sensitive area of the pixel detector, surround the pixel matrix to supply the voltage and form the electric field on the sensor edge. Nevertheless, the situation there is more complex and the design of guard rings is crucial for suppressing the leakage current and pushing up the limit of breakdown voltage.
- Tool: TCAD
- Tasks: Simulate the guard rings of test structures, find out and discuss the impacts of the design and the operation conditions on related sensor performances.  Find out or design an optimum guard ring geometry.
- Possible extension: include the radiation damage and discuss the impacts.
