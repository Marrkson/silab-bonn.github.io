- Type: Master
- Location: SiLab
- Contact: [Sinuo Zhang](mailto:s.zhang@physik.uni-bonn.de)
- Description: Guard rings, located outside of the sensitive area of the silicon pixel detector, surround the pixel matrix improving breakdown voltage and reducing leakage current. 
- Task: Simulate and optimize the guard rings designs, find out and discuss the impacts of the design and the operation conditions on related sensor performances.  Find out or design an optimum guard ring geometry.
- Tool: [TCAD](https://www.synopsys.com/silicon/tcad.html)
- Possible extension: include the radiation damage and discuss the impacts.

- Description: SiC (Silicon-Carbide) is a semiconductor that provides several interesting characteristics when operated as a particle detector. It is insensitive to visible light, has lower leakage current compared to silicon and can be operated at high temperatures. Two sets of SiC pad diodes of different thicknesses, namely 40 µm and 110 µm, have been designed and fabricated.
- Task: A full electrical characterization, including IV- and CV characteristics, needs to be performed. Followingly, the diodes behavior, operated as a detector (sensor), can be quantified using radioactive sources.
- Tools: Multiple measurement instruments, python
