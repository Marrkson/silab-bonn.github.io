- Type: Master
- Location: SiLab
- Contact: [Sinuo Zhang](mailto:s.zhang@physik.uni-bonn.de)
- Description: Guard rings, located outside of the sensitive area of the pixel detector, surround the pixel matrix to supply the voltage and form the electric field on the sensor edge. Nevertheless, the situation there is more complex and the design of guard rings is crucial for suppressing the leakage current and pushing up the limit of breakdown voltage.
- Tool: TCAD
- Tasks: Simulate the guard rings of test structures, find out and discuss the impacts of the design and the operation conditions on related sensor performances.  Find out or design an optimum guard ring geometry.
- Possible extension: include the radiation damage and discuss the impacts.

- Description: SiC (Silicon-Carbide) is a semiconductor that provides several interesting characteristics when operated as a sensitive volume. It is insensitive to visible light, has lower leakage current compared to pure Silicon and can be operated at high temperatures. Two sets of SiC pad diodes of different thicknesses, namely 40 µm and 110 µm, have been designed and fabricated. First, a full electrical characterization, including IV- and CV characteristics, needs to be performed. Followingly, the diodes behaviour, operated as a detector (sensor), can be quantified using radioactive sources as well as readout circuitry.
