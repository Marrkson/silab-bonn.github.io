# Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors

Monolithic pixel detectors are a rather novel approach that combine the sensor (where charges are created) and the readout part (digitization) on the same wafer.
This approach makes costly production steps like combining two different chips for sensor and readout redundant.

The development from our group (in collaboration with CERN and institutes from France) focuses on building such monolithic devices with radiation hardness and timing capabilities comparable to the requirements of ATLAS outer pixel layers.

- Description: Charge measurements in lab experiments and test beam campaigns at particle accelerators produce charge information given in _time over threshold_ (TOT). 
This value is unique for every chip and front-end setting.
In order to express the charge in a common unit (electrons) a charge calibration with radioactive sources is necessary to relate electrons to TOT.
These measurements have to be performed and analysed for multiple TJ-Monopix1 chips, including measuring in a controlled climate chamber and writing software for analysis.
