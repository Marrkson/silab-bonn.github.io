- Description: A replacement/upgrade of the entire PXD is planned in the spring of 2021. A small number of detector modules will be characterized in Bonn. Characterization includes electrical and functionality tests of the **A**pplication **S**pecific **I**ntegrated **C**ircuits (ASICs) on the modules and optimization of the sensor response with radioactive sources. If possible also improvements of the testing procedures (mostly steered by Python scripts) and development of new tests will be part of the work.

- Description: The PXD has to withstand a large amount of ionizing radiation in the experiment. To investigate the effects on the ASICs and the sensors, dedicated irradiation campaigns with high intensity X-ray tubes and electron sources are planned starting this fall.
