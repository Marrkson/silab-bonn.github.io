- Description: Charge measurements in lab experiments and test beam campaigns at particle accelerators produce charge information given in _time over threshold_ (TOT). 
This value is unique for every chip and front-end setting.
In order to express the charge in a common unit (electrons) a charge calibration with radioactive sources is necessary to relate electrons to TOT.
These measurements have to be performed and analysed for multiple TJ-Monopix1 chips, including measuring in a controlled climate chamber and writing software for analysis.
