A newly-installed proton irradiation site at the [Bonn isochronous cyclotron](https://www.zyklotron.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/zyklo_e/index.html) at the [Helmholtz Institut für Strahlen- und Kernphysik (HISKP)](https://www.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/) allows radiation damage studies of prototype silicon detectors for state-of-the-art, high-energy physics experiments such as [**ATLAS**](https://atlas.cern/) and [**BELLE 2**](https://www.belle2.org/). Especially pixel detectors are positioned close to the interaction point due to their high spatial resolution and tracking capabilities. Therefore, they are exposed to a harsh radiation environment which dictates their lifetime. In order to verify that the detectors meet requirements, radiation damage studies are necessary for prototype detector concepts.

- Description: Radiation levels within a close vicinity of the cooling box shortly after irradiation of samples are in the low **mSv/h** region. Since this lies in the order of the average equivalent dose **per year** in Germany ([~ 2 mSv / year](https://www.bfs.de/EN/topics/ion/environment/natural-radiation-exposure/natural-radiation-exposure_node.html)) it requires thorough consideration when planning any worksteps. In order to get a quantitative measure of radiation levels at the setup, a gas discharge counter can be used. The aim of this work is to integrate such a device into hard- and software as well as performing an approximate _counts-to-dose_ calibration. Interpretation/visualization of the data have to be implemented and integrated into an already existing Python application.
