A [proton irradiation site](https://www.zyklotron.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/zyklo/experiments_cyclotron_EN.html) at the [Bonn isochronous cyclotron](https://www.zyklotron.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/zyklo/bonn_isochronous_cyclotron_EN.html) at the [Helmholtz Institut f√ºr Strahlen- und Kernphysik (HISKP)](https://www.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/) allows radiation damage studies of prototype silicon detectors for state-of-the-art, high-energy physics experiments such as [**ATLAS**](https://atlas.cern/) and [**BELLE 2**](https://www.belle2.org/). Especially pixel detectors, which are typically positioned close to the interaction point to enable high spatial resolution for tracking, are exposed to harsh radiation environments which dictate their lifetime. In order to verify that the detectors meet requirements, radiation damage studies are necessary for prototype detector concepts.
