A newly-installed proton irradiation site at the [Bonn isochronous cyclotron](https://www.zyklotron.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/zyklo_en/index.html) at the [Helmholtz Institut f√ºr Strahlen- und Kernphysik (HISKP)](https://www.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/) allows radiation damage studies of prototype silicon detectors for state-of-the-art, high-energy physics experiments such as [**ATLAS**](https://atlas.cern/) and [**BELLE 2**](https://www.belle2.org/). Especially pixel detectors are positioned close to the interaction point due to their high spatial resolution and tracking capabilities. Therefore, they are exposed to a harsh radiation environment which dictates their lifetime. In order to verify that the detectors meet requirements, radiation damage studies are necessary for prototype detector concepts.
