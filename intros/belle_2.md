The [**BELLE 2**](https://www.belle2.org/) particle collision experiment in Japan started taking data in spring 2019. A european collaboration led by Germany developed the pixel detector (PXD) for particle tracking and vertex determination in the experiment. The sensors of the PXD are based on **DE**pleted **P**-channel **F**ield **E**ffect **T**ransistors (DEPFETs). The SiLab group has been involved for 10 years in the investigation of this technology and the development and testing of the final components.
