Dedicated beam test campaigns are regularily conducted by our group to measure the hit detection efficiency of pixel detectors.
This measurements needs a high-energy particle beam provided by accelerators and an array of detector planes to identify unique particle tracks.
With that information one can confirm if the device under test (a so called DUT) also registered a hit at that time and at the predicted location.

The required setups consist of many devices and components of which a lot are developed and built by our group.
